A website featuring a video of Derek Zoolander being ousted as the top male fashion model by a rising star has received the following complaint:

```no-highlight
What is this? A video for ants!?
How can we be expected to watch this video if we can't even see who is in it?
The video has to be at least...3 times bigger than this
```

You have been hired as a freelance developer to address this complaint.
The owner of the website previously sent you an email with the website's files.
Unfortunately, they accidentally only attached the `src` folder to the email, and they are currently not able to send you the rest of their files because their computer was smashed to pieces by a male model.
Apparently, the male model was trying to access some files in the computer, but they thought the files were physically **inside** of the computer.

## Setup
In you `challenges` folder run:

```sh
$ et get hot-model-replacement
$ cd hot-model-replacement
```

## Deliverables
1. Get the website running using Webpack. In your project root, you will need to create a `webpack.config.js` with your Webpack configuration. You will also need to create a `package.json` file. You should do this via `npm init` and `npm install`ing all the packages that you need. Lastly, you will need to create a `build` folder containing an `index.html` file which references your Webpack bundle file.
2. Make the width and length of the video three times bigger. In the `src` folder, `app.scss` is the only file which you should modify to accomplish this. Do not touch the other files that have been provided to you.
